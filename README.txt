Modified application taken from "Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide" by Ben Phillips and Brian Hardy
This application is a modified version of the "Hello Moon" project
This project is an experiment of playing sound within an Android application.

When run, this project displays a single panel with a picture of Avenged Sevenfold's guitarist in the background.
At the bottom of the screen are three buttons: "Play", "Pause" and "Stop". By pressing the "Play" button, the solo from 
the song "Bat Country" plays on the device. Hitting "Pause" pauses the song at the current second within the sound clip. 
Hitting "Stop" at any time resets the audio back to the 0th second of the sound clip.

**Please note that I do not own the song "Bat Country" used within this project. The .mp4 has been omitted for copyright purposes. 
The sound clip originally resided within the res/raw directory. Due to the omission the project will not run without some replacement
of audio and a change in the code to reference the new audio file.
